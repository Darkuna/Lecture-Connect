The following steps are necessary to build a new version of Lecture-Connect:

1. Enter the src/ directory and build the .jar file using `./mvnw clean install -DskipTests`
2. Enter the docker/ directory and run docker-compose up --build

The application as well as the mysql database should start automatically now.
